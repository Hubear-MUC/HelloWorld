Version History:
----------------

Version 2.1

Redesigned the code to make it more easily readable and maintainable.
Redesigned the "Hello world"- message to make it look a bit more spectacular.


Version 2.0

Made the Output a little bolder with adding Asterisks to it.
Thus increasing the mayor version number for celebration.
Besides a "Hello world" program is just supposed to present this message on the screen. Thus a by far more beautiful message means a by far highter version number.


Version 1.3

Placed the printf()- call in a separate line to make the code easier to read and to maintain.


Version 1.2

Added the dot at the end of the sentence again so that now the new line- character "beautifies" the output and additionally the grammar is correct again.


Version 1.1

Replaced the dot in the "Hello World"- message by a new line- character to make the message more readable in the terminal window.


Version 1.0

Initial version.
